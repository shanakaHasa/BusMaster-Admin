Overview
This project utilizes machine learning models to predict travel time and classify user feedback. The KNeighborsRegressor model is employed for predicting travel time, while logistic regression is used to classify user feedback.

Features
Travel Time Prediction:

The travel time is predicted based on various factors, including:
Company time
School time
Weather conditions
Regular traffic time
Date
Relevant current time and date when a person boards the bus.
Data Generation:

The project involves generating data to train and test the models effectively.
Real-Time Data Processing:

Firebase is used for real-time data processing, allowing the system to handle data updates dynamically.
Flutter App Integration:

A Flutter app is built to provide users with a seamless experience. Users can scan a QR code using the app, and relevant date_time information is extracted for further processing.
